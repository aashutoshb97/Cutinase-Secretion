# Protein_embeddings_CutinaseSecretion
This repository is implementation of protein embedding code developed by Kevin Yang (Frances Arnold Group) for designing signal peptide sequences for cutinase secretion in Bacillus Subtilis

Learned protein embeddings for machine learning
https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/34/15/2642/4951834

The embedding training is performed for the '1000'[small] and '0.5 million sequences'[original].

The input files are in 2 formats -
A) Only the signal peptide sequences and
B) Signal peptide sequences followed by the junction 'AEF' and the cutinase sequence

The dataset is obtained from the following paper -
